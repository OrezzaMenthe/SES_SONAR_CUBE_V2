Ouistiti - Small HTTP server
============================

Ouistiti is the french name of [Marmoset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmoset) a little Monkey of the New world. The choice of the name comes from the size of this monkey and the pronunciation _(Ëˆwistiti)_ which remembers HTTP.
 
The main goal of Ouistiti is a very small HTTP server to be embedded into
very small devices.

 all features statically linked:   66ko  
 with the features as modules: 35ko  
 in embedded configuration:    29ko  

libhttpserver
=============

Ouistiti is build over the libhttpserver library. This library is an
external project and may be use into other projects.

The project is available on github

    https://github.com/mchalain/libhttpserver

This library may be integrated into another application to allows
a HTTP service.

Dependencies
============

Ouistiti is written to be build on a maximum of system. The code is 
C standard, the threads may be disabled and the configuration may be
loaded from memory.

For an optimal featured solution, Ouistiti needs:
 * pthread library
 * libconfig library

Some modules need external libraries:
 * mbedtls library
 * libb64 library (as a git submodule)

The memory allocation is dynamic, but the functions "calloc" and "free" are
inside macros, to allow the specific implementation.

Platforms support
=================

The first version ran on Linux and Windows.
Currently only the Linux version is tested.

Features
========

 1) Multi HTTP versions: The server configuration may set the version
  of HTTP to response: HTTP/0.9 HTTP/1.0 HTTP/1.1 .
  HTTP/2.0 may be possible with a future modules.

 2) Keep Alive connection: The client connection may be keep between
 several requests.

 3) HTTP pipelining: The server in HTTP/1.1 and over may receive several
 requests and send the responses in the same time.
 
 5) HTTP streaming: A module may send big binary file or live streaming.

 4) HTTPS: SSL connection is available as module with mbedtls library.

 5) CGI/1.1: CGI scripts may be call from the client. The server may
 run "webmin".

 6) Authentication: Basic authentication is available.

Build and installation
======================

The first step is to add the libhttpserver source tree.

    git clone https://github.com/mchalain/libhttpserver

The project configuration may be done with the "config" file edition
(a "default.config" file is available). Or it may be done with "configure"
script.

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64/ouistiti --sysconfdir=/etc

Other build setup are available into the "config" file (see Build Setup chapter).

The compilation is done with make and accept configuration in command line.

    make DEBUG=y

The installation will copy the library into /usr/local/lib/ directory,
and binary into /usr/local/bin with the default configuration. The paths
may be changed during the project configuration (see below)

    make DESTDIR=~/packages/ouistiti install

Build setup
==============

Each option may be set with "y" to be included. Other value disables the
feature.

DEBUG : allow more debug traces and add debugger symbols.

STATIC_CONFIG : use the configuration defined into the src/config.h file.
FILE_CONFIG : use the ouistiti.conf file for the configuration.

VTHREAD : enable the multithreading into the server.
STATIC : build the application and the modules into one binary file.
DYNAMIC :  allow to load dynamicly the modules.

MBEDTLS : build the SSL/TLS support with mbedtls.
CGI : build the CGI/1.1 support.
STATIC_FILE : build the delivery of static files.
SENDFILE : build the extension of STATIC_FILE to increase the speed.
AUTH : build the support of the authentication.
AUTHN_BASIC_CONF : build a Basic authentication method with simple configuration.

Configuration
=============

Ouistiti uses [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/) for the configuration. The configuration file
looks like a C file, with variables and structure.
