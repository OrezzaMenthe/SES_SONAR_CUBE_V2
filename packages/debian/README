To build debian package:
 - build mbedtls with "make SHARED=1" and copy libraries and include/mbedtls directory into libhttpserver/src
 - configure with options --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/ouistiti --sysconfdir=/etc/ouistiti
 - run make and make DESTDIR=/tmp/ouistiti install
 - verify if mbedtls libraries are into /tmp/ouistiti/usr/lib/ouistiti or make a copy
 - copy the debian directory as /tmp/ouistiti/DEBIAN
 - modify /tmp/ouistiti/etc/ouistiti/ouistiti.conf to set the user with www-data
 - create /tmp/ouistiti/srv/www/htdocs and /tmp/ouistiti/srv/cgi-bin
 - copy the docs directory files into /tmp/ouistiti/srv/www/htdocs
 - run dpkg-deb -b /tmp/ouistiti
